WINDOCK USER GUIDE:

A "TRIGGER" is an area of the screen that is specified by the user. When dragging a window 
by its title bar, if the mouse enters or touches the TRIGGER area, it will be activated. 
TRIGGERS can be corners, edges, or areas of a monitor.

A "DOCK" is a position/size of a window, specified by the user, where the dragged window 
will snap to.

A "RULE" consists of one DOCK, and a corresponding TRIGGER.

A "PROFILE" consists of multiple RULES. Only one PROFILE can be active at a time and only 
the RULES in this PROFILE will be in effect.

Users can switch between multiple PROFILES they create.

NOTE:
The order of the RULES within a PROFILE is significant. If multiple TRIGGERS overlap, ones 
higher up on the list will take priority. The exception to this, is that any corner TRIGGER 
will take priority over any edge TRIGGER, which in turn takes priority over any area TRIGGER 
regardless of their order within the PROFILE.
